# Encryption Library

This library provides functionality for encrypting and decrypting data using AES-256 and XOR algorithms. It utilizes the Windows Cryptography API (bcrypt) for AES encryption and decryption.

## Features

- **AES-256 Encryption/Decryption**
- **XOR Encryption/Decryption**
- **Random IV Generation**

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- `bcrypt.lib` library for AES algorithm

## Setup

- Clone this repository
- Open Visual Studio Project
- Compile in 64-bit Architecture
- Move headers from includes/ directory to your project and include
- Link library to your file via (#pragma comment(lib, libName))
- Enjoy

## Usage

### Creating a Payload Object

- This library works through one object; a Payload.

- To create one, you need to provide the data to be encrypted/decrypted, the encryption key, an initialization vector (IV) for AES, and the algorithm type (AES or XOR).
This object contains the encrypt() and decrypt() methods for a streamlined approach to cryptography.

#### Example

```cpp
#include "crypto.h"

int main() {
    UCHAR payload[] = "Your data here"; // Data to be encrypted
    SIZE_T payloadSize = sizeof(data) - 1; // Size of the data

    UCHAR key[] = "Your32ByteEncryptionKeyForAES256";
    SIZE_T keySize = sizeof(key) - 1; // Size of the key

    std::vector<UCHAR> iv = GenerateRandomIV(); // Generate a random IV for AES

    int algorithm = AES; // Specify the algorithm (AES or XOR)

    // Create the Payload object
    Payload payload(payload, payloadSize, key, keySize, iv, algorithm);

    // Now you may use the payload object for encryption and decryption
    return 0;
}
